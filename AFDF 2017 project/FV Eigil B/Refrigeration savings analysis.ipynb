    "# Refrigeration System Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This  analyis estimates the fuel savings that could be achieved by upgrading the refrigeration system on board F/V Eigil B. The calculation has three parts: first, parameters of the refrigeration systems are determined. Second, the fuel consumption rate of the generators is calculated as a function of load. Finally, the annual fuel consumption due to refrigeration is calculated based on the generator fuel consumption curves and the refrigeration load.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses a simple model of new systems. The model includes a compressor (or two), two circulation pumps with vfd control, a condenser pump, a compressor cooling pump and a general term for system efficiency. A VFD on the compressor is not included, because it was found to have little value. The performance of the new compressors was looked up at a range of saturated suction temperatures and the data were used to estimate pump-down time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model of the old system uses the same components, but without any VFD control on the circulating pumps. Because I haven't been able to find performance data for the old compressor, its assumed to run at constant power rather than a power dependent on operating conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook. A Jupyter Notebook allows text, figures and computer code to be presented in one document. Here, text is presented in black font fully left justified, while computer code (Python in this case) is presented a color-coded font and indented. Variables are defined and calculations are performed in the computer code \"cells,\" while explanations are presented in the text \"cells.\""

Data sheets for the 4045TFM75 reveals that the engine is rated to 80 kW under M1 conditions (operating over 3000 hours per year and load factors over 65%) and to 101 kW under M3 conditions (up to 2000 hours per year, and load factors under 50%). Since the both auxiliary generators use the same engine, the same fuel consumption curve is used for each."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The old system was estimated at 1729 gal/yr, while the new system was estimated at 1655 gal/yr with the Bitzer system and 2253 gal/yr with the Frascold system (with no VFD). With a VFD installed on the circ pump, the estimated fuel consumption is 1335 and 1609 gal/yr for the Frascold and the Bitzer, respectively. The Mycom system is modeled to have a lower fuel consumption than the new Frascold system with no VFD primarily because of a change in capacity. The Mycom system is modeled with a higher capacity, which allows the hold to be pumped down faster and reduce fuel. This is particularly impactful when heat infiltration is included. The time to cool is given by the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta T C_p V}{C_{comp} - h} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ is the time required to achieve a change in temperature $\\Delta T$, $C_p$ is the heat capacity of water, and $V$ is the volume of water. $C_{comp}$ is the compressor capacity and $h$ is the rate of heat infiltration. As $C_{comp}$ approaches $h$, the $\\Delta t$ increases dramatically. This effect has a large influence on the Frascold system when it is used to cool both holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still problems with these estimates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Specific data for the old compressor is not available. The various estimates for the old compressor performance cannot be verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Inefficiency beyond manufacturer specs have not been measured, so there is little evidence to support the 0.95 factor used in this analysis."
